# Leiden-a-VR-Fantasy-dungeon-crawler-proof-of-concept-

This project was created using Unity, designed for the Oculus rift and acts as a proof of concept for the game Leiden (suffer), a german folk-lore inspired game that sees a Wizard trapped in an alternate reality, needing to explore, defeat enemies and collect gold to be able to afford the magical fuel needed to return to his world. 

The world is a procedurally generated maze of x size which has a generation bias towards an intended maze length i.e. the developer can set an intended length for a level and once that mark has been passed, the bias will rapidly increase until it's so strong that the generator would create a straight line towards the end goal (however it very rarely reaches that point). The world also contains a procedurally generated event list, where each map cell has a set event that follows a list of spawning rules and takes biases into account as to not repeat the same rooms.

Spells were created using Unity's particle system. Enemy AI and turrets were created by Chenyang Fu and permission was given for their inclusion.

This game is a proof of concept and acts as a prototype. Much work would still be needed to get this game to being a commercial product.
